#??? the problem solves it self imo, the algorithm proposed does not guarantee an optimal solution and the only way
#i can think i could is just backtracking and making every solution, of course the ending clause is a bit of a nifty thing
#considering S does not contain U, the absolute minimum amount of partitions needed to cover U is 2, the per-case minimum
#however? i have no clue how, if you could even determine that before actually finding said solution in order to use it as
#an end case for recursion when you reach a solution of ideal length
#not implementing this since its pointless really and the math for the aforementioned possibly computable ideal number of
#sub sets used is above what i know how to do
